practice
========
This is little project that was done for university practice. 
Main goal is draft of js plug-in that creates a table, that can communicate with OData source.
OData was selected as its standard provides a set of URL query parameters to filter, sort data and some other pretty things.

In future it should be united with some other components in nuget package.

File with the most of functionality is jquery.oDataTable.js.

Now it's included in aspnet project for testing. For launch it needs to be compiled and hosted with IIS or IIS Express.

the simplest way to check it is run it with Visual Studio or WebMatrix.
